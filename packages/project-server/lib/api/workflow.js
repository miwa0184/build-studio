## CONTEXT BUDGET — READ THIS

You have a context window of {{CONTEXT_BUDGET}}. Be efficient:
1. Execute your primary task FIRST — don't explore the codebase extensively before acting
2. Report feedback as soon as you have results — don't keep investigating
3. If you need to read files, read only what's necessary for your task
4. Do NOT attempt to fix issues outside your assigned scope
5. If you're stuck or unsure, report what you know and stop — don't burn context exploring`;

// Fix-execution agents are doing root-cause investigation by definition —
// they're called BECAUSE QA / review found a bug that requires diagnosis.
// The standard EFFICIENCY_INSTRUCTIONS' "don't explore extensively" and
// "if stuck, stop" rules fight against legitimate debugging. This variant
// permits investigation but keeps scope discipline + the soft compaction
// threshold. Observed failure (example-ios PRD-009 fix-1, 2026-05-23): agent
// found a real reactive-binding bug behind a test failure but was nudged
// by the standard rules toward shipping a partial-symptom fix.
const FIX_EXECUTION_EFFICIENCY_INSTRUCTIONS = `

## FIX-TASK CONTEXT BUDGET — READ THIS

You have {{CONTEXT_BUDGET}}. Fix tasks involve investigation — that's why this is a separate step from initial implementation. Don't rush a fix that requires understanding the bug.

1. **Investigation is expected.** Read enough to understand WHY the test fails, not just patch the symptom. A failing identifier check often hides a reactive-binding, seam fixture, or observer-notification bug behind it. Trace the data path.
2. **Trust your diagnostic instincts.** If a test passes after your initial fix but other related tests now fail differently, you patched a symptom — not the cause. Keep going.
3. **Stay within the assigned scope.** If your investigation reveals a deeper bug outside this fix task's scope, document it in your feedback as an Action Item for fix_plan — do NOT expand the current task to fix everything you find.
4. **Commit incrementally** as you make verified progress. Compaction won't lose committed work — uncommitted investigation IS at risk.
5. **At >{{SOFT_THRESHOLD}} consumed without a complete fix**, stop and POST your investigation findings as Action Items rather than burning more context. fix_plan will reassign with a fresh context budget plus your findings as a hint.

## ITERATION DISCIPLINE — DON'T SPIRAL

6. **Scope every test run to the failure.** While iterating, run ONLY the failing test(s) via \`-only-testing:Target/Class[/method]\` — NEVER the full \`xcodebuild test\` / whole suite. A full iOS suite run costs minutes per cycle; qa_validation re-runs the whole suite once at the end. Repeated full-suite runs are the #1 cause of fix-step time + context blowups.
7. **Cap attempts, then escalate.** If the SAME test still fails after ~3 focused attempts, STOP. Post your diagnosis + the specific recommended fix as Action Items (for fix_plan / human triage) instead of trying a 4th. A 4th+ attempt on the same failure rarely converges — escalating with a clear hypothesis is faster than spiralling.
8. **Screenshot / PR-evidence failures = check the FIXTURE first.** A blank, empty, or wrong-data capture almost always means the test didn't seed the state it asserts on (no open phase, empty store, missing record). Fix the test's data-seeding/setup. Do NOT modify production code to make a screenshot pass — that risks changing real behaviour to satisfy an evidence artifact.
9. **Leave no debug cruft.** If you add temporary logging/probes (NSLog, print, etc.) to diagnose, REMOVE them before reporting. Never commit debug code.`;

**Your job is to produce a JSON plan of fix tasks based on the review feedback below. You do NOT write code. You do NOT fix bugs yourself. You do NOT run tests. Each task in your plan is dispatched to a separate Dev agent for execution.**

**FORBIDDEN FEEDBACK FORMAT** — your feedback will be REJECTED if you use any of these patterns:
- \`**All issues addressed:** yes|no\` / \`**Committed:** <hash>\` / \`### Changes\` (fix-report format — you plan fixes, you don't execute them)
- \`**Approved:** yes|no\` / \`**Blocking:** N\` / \`### Findings\` (review format — you are not re-reviewing; you trust the upstream review and plan against it)
- Any phrasing that implies you made code changes or ran tests

**REQUIRED FEEDBACK FORMAT** — your feedback MUST contain a \`\`\`json code block with a \`tasks\` array. Each task object specifies the fix to make + the role to assign it to. The workflow parses this JSON and launches one Dev agent per task. Plain text or prose-only feedback will be rejected.

**IF THE UPSTREAM FEEDBACK IS EMPTY OR AMBIGUOUS:** Output \`{ "tasks": [] }\` and explain in a short prose note why no fix tasks are needed (or why the feedback was unparseable). The workflow handles 0-task plans as "no fixes needed" and advances to the next step.

PRD path: ${wf.prdPath}

Use the /fix_planner skill. A post-implementation review step ("${sourceStep}") found blocking issues.

## Available execution roles:
${roleList}

**CHOOSING THE RIGHT ROLE PER TASK.** When multiple execution roles are
listed above, the right role for each task is determined by the FILES the
task will modify — NOT by which role ran the original task_execution.
Mapping:
- Swift / SwiftUI / iOS APIs / \`.xcodeproj\` / iOS test targets / \`.entitlements\` / \`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\` / \`Info.plist\` → \`/ios_dev\`
- HTML / CSS / JS / TS / React / Svelte / Vue / Astro / Vite / Tailwind / web frameworks → \`/frontend_dev\`
- Server code (Node/Go/Python backends), SQL migrations, API contracts, server-side auth → \`/backend_dev\`
- Kotlin / Jetpack Compose / Android Studio → \`/android_dev\`
- Infrastructure-as-code, CI YAML, Docker / Kubernetes → \`/devops\`

If a task touches files predominantly owned by one role, assign that role.
Cross-cutting work goes to the role whose conventions cover the MAJORITY
of the change. **Do not default to whichever role ran the previous
task_execution.** The fix loop is the right place to correct mis-assigned
work — if task_execution ran as Frontend Dev but the actual fix is in
Swift files, the fix task assignment is iOS Dev.

      instruction: `## YOU FILE REVIEW FINDINGS AS BACKLOG ITEMS — YOU DO NOT FIX ANYTHING

A review step ("${sourceStep}") produced findings. Your job: turn them into the
SMALLEST sensible set of self-contained backlog items, staged for the owner's
approval. You write ONLY into \`${stagingRel}/\`. You do NOT edit docs/backlog/,
you do NOT edit docs/project-state.md, you do NOT commit, you do NOT fix code.

## GROUPING — BE AGGRESSIVE (this is the whole point)

The owner does not want one item per finding. Minimize item count:
- **Same locus / same subsystem** → one item (e.g. a BLOCKING and a MEDIUM both in publish.ts step-7 → one bug).
- **Small, unrelated one-liners** → combine into ONE "cheap sweep" item EVEN IF unrelated, so they ride a single bugfix workflow and a single regression cycle. The owner explicitly does not want to fix a one-line bug, wait for regression, then fix another one-line bug and wait again.
- Give a **substantial** finding its own item only when its fix + test genuinely needs independent review (most BLOCKING findings; anything large or risky).
- Never merge two things that truly need independent verification just to cut the count.

Aim: 15 findings → a handful of items, not 15.

## TYPE — Bug vs Task

- **Bug**: a defect in behavior that shipped or should work — needs repro test + fix + regression.
- **Task**: non-defect work — refactor, dead-code removal, doc fix, test-only hardening, hygiene.
- A finding that actually needs a PRD (a real feature, multi-surface) → a **Task** titled "Scope PRD for <X>". Findings rarely need this.

## SELF-CONTAINED BODIES (mandatory)

Whoever picks up the item sees only the file — never this review. Each item body MUST have:
- A one-paragraph statement of the problem.
- **Every absorbed finding as its own \`### <SEVERITY> — <short label>\` subsection**, carrying that finding's failure scenario + \`file:line\` anchors. VERIFY each anchor against the CURRENT source before writing it; fix stale line numbers.
- A **Fix design** section (concrete, per the review's suggested direction).
- **Acceptance** bullets, including the regression test each bug needs.

## OUTPUT — write these files, nothing else

For each proposed item, in \`${stagingRel}/\`:
1. \`<tempId>.md\` — the item BODY ONLY (markdown; NO YAML frontmatter — the engine adds it). tempId = a short slug like \`a\`, \`b\`, \`sweep\`.
2. Then write \`${stagingRel}/manifest.json\` LAST (its presence signals you are done):
\`\`\`json
{
  "sourceStep": "${sourceStep}",
  "prefix": "${prefix}",
  "summary": "<N> findings (<b> blocking, <m> medium, <l> low) → <k> items",
  "items": [
    { "tempId": "a", "title": "<concise, specific>", "type": "Bug", "release": "<one of the releases below>",
      "absorbs": ["BLOCKING: <label>", "MEDIUM: <label>"], "bodyFile": "a.md", "rationale": "<why grouped this way>" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## PROJECT FACTS

- Backlog id prefix: **${prefix}** (the engine assigns real numbers on commit — your tempIds are placeholders).
- Existing release headings (pick the best fit per item; bugs usually go to a "Bugs — fix next" heading if present, else the earliest active release):
${releases.length ? releases.map(r => `  - ${r}`).join('\n') : '  (none parsed — use "Bugs — fix next")'}
- All items are filed with status Backlog and prd: null (the engine sets these).

## FINDINGS FROM ${sourceStep}

${feedback || '(no findings feedback captured — if truly empty, write a manifest with an empty items array and a note)'}
${note ? `\n## OWNER REGROUPING INSTRUCTIONS (this is a re-proposal — honor these)\n\n${note}\n` : ''}

When done, your final message: one line — "Staged <k> items from <N> findings." The manifest is what the owner reads.

If an AC has no implementation at all, mark it BLOCKING. Include an "AC Coverage" section in your review listing each AC and whether it's covered by the code changes.\n8. **MOCK-ONLY COVERAGE** — Check if any acceptance criteria that depend on external services (LLM calls, third-party APIs, hardware) are only tested with mocked responses. Flag these as "MOCK-ONLY — real integration unverified" in your review so they are flagged for manual testing during demo review. Not all projects use mocks — only flag this when the project's tests actually mock external dependencies.\n9. **MULTI-ANGLE RECALL** — cover these angles explicitly (each has shipped real merged defects): (a) correctness across ALL entity/type variants the spec covers and BOTH directions of every toggle — not just the path the implementation took; (b) silent fail-safe drops (returns 200 while quietly discarding an invalid field); (c) removed or weakened prior behavior; (d) cross-file / contract drift; (e) altitude — a third copy of logic that will drift; (f) dead / unused error contracts; (g) test scaffolding leaked into production (env hooks, ungated test seams).\n\nThis is round ${wf.round}.${reviewContext}`;

- \`taskIndex\` MUST be the integer \`${taskIdx}\` (zero-indexed: this is Task ${taskIdx + 1}, index ${taskIdx}). Required field. Not a string.

If you have been compacted and lost this prompt, the original is in your current working directory as \`prompt-*.txt\` — \`ls prompt-*.txt\` then read it to recover the exact curl line.

   * memory cost: a 4-round review left 21 windows from rounds 1-3 resident

   * thrashing agent stops responding to input — which is how two agents ended
   * up unreachable and unnudgeable on 2026-07-30/31.

Do not raise issues about excluded items.\n3. **Companion specs are OUT OF SCOPE for this review.** Companion-spec files (UX-XXX, ADRs, copy specs, and anything in docs/ux/, docs/brand/, docs/adrs/, etc.) are written and refined in the dedicated \`companion_specs\` step that runs AFTER this PRD review approves. Do NOT raise BLOCKING findings about missing or incomplete content inside companion-spec files — those gaps will be closed by the spec owner in the next step. If the PRD itself fails to anchor a decision that the companion spec needs, raise it as a NON-BLOCKING action item for the \`companion_specs\` step instead of blocking PRD approval.\n4. **Do not introduce new features.** Your job is to verify the proposed scope is correct and complete, not to expand it.\n5. **After round 2, only raise genuinely new issues.** If your concern was addressed in a previous round, confirm it is resolved — do not re-raise it or raise tangential follow-ups.\n6. **Classify each finding** as BLOCKING (must fix before implementation) or NON-BLOCKING (observation, can fix later). Be conservative with BLOCKING — most issues are non-blocking.\n7. **If you have no issues, set Approved: yes and all counts to 0.** Do not invent concerns to justify your review.\n\nThis is round ${wf.round}.`,

## YOUR TASK — ENUMERATE THE MATRIX, THEN COVER EVERY CELL

This is test-DRIVEN development: the tests you write here define the coverage contract the implementation must satisfy. **Enumerate the full acceptance-criteria × variant matrix from the SPEC first, then write a test for every relevant cell** — do not just cover the happy path of each AC.

1. Read the PRD completely, plus its data model / companion specs (ADRs, API contracts, copy specs). Extract every acceptance criterion (AC-N / US-N.M).
2. For each AC, enumerate the VARIANT AXES the spec makes relevant:
   - **Entity / type variants** — every entity class or type the AC applies to, not just the common one.
   - **State variants** — each state an entity can be in when the AC fires.
   - **Direction / toggle variants** — BOTH directions of every toggle/transition, plus re-entrancy.
   - **Payload shapes** — empty / single-field / multi-field / **invalid**.
3. Check existing test files — skip cells already covered; do NOT duplicate.
4. Write a test for EVERY uncovered relevant cell. **Negative / rejection cells must assert rejection** (error thrown, non-2xx, field absent from output) — a test that only asserts the happy path does NOT cover the invalid cell (a handler that silently drops bad input and returns success would pass it).
5. Commit your test files.
6. Report the coverage matrix (format below).

Do NOT run the tests. The feature is not implemented yet — running them would waste time, and red/failing tests are expected (that's TDD). Just write and commit.

## NO TEST-COUNT CAP — THE MATRIX IS THE BOUND, KEEP TESTS CHEAP

There is **no cap** on the number of tests — write exactly as many as the matrix requires: one per relevant cell, and no more. Only enumerate cells the spec makes real — skip anything in the PRD's "Out of scope" section and variants the data model doesn't allow. Control total COST by picking the cheapest level that covers each cell (below), not by writing fewer tests.

## TEST LEVEL — USE THE SIMPLEST LEVEL THAT WORKS

Unit test is the DEFAULT. Only escalate to integration when unit testing is impossible.

- **Unit test** — test a function/module directly. Import it, call it, assert the result. Use this for: validation logic, data transforms, state machines, parsing, formatting, business rules, utility functions. If the AC says "validate X returns error for Y" — that's a unit test of the validation function, NOT an HTTP test.
- **Integration test** — test multiple modules working together through an API endpoint. Use ONLY when the AC specifically requires verifying the HTTP layer (status codes, headers, auth middleware, request routing). If you can test the same logic by importing the handler/function directly, use a unit test instead.

DO NOT write integration/HTTP tests for:
- Input validation (test the validator function directly)
- Business logic (test the service/module directly)
- Data formatting (test the formatter directly)
- Error messages (test the function that generates them)${qaIosGuidance}

## WHAT NOT TO TEST — CRITICAL

- **No LLM/AI API tests** — no real calls (costs money), no mocked calls (proves nothing). Mark LLM-dependent cells as MANUAL.
- **No E2E / browser tests** — the CI gate will reject them (this is web/Playwright; iOS XCUITests are covered by the iOS guidance above where present).
- **No trivial tests** — "renders without error", "exports exist", etc.

## FEEDBACK FORMAT

**Approved:** yes
**Test files:** list of files created

**Your job is to produce a task plan for the PRD. You do NOT write code. You do NOT fix bugs. You do NOT run tests. You decompose the PRD into discrete tasks for downstream execution agents.**

**FORBIDDEN FEEDBACK FORMAT** — your feedback will be REJECTED if you use any of these patterns (these are FIX-REPORT or REVIEW formats from AGENTS.md, used by Dev / Reviewer agents in OTHER steps — wrong for your role):
- \`**All issues addressed:** yes|no\` / \`**Committed:** <hash>\` / \`### Changes\` (fix-report format — you are not a fix agent)
- \`**Approved:** yes|no\` / \`**Blocking:** N\` / \`### Findings\` (review format — you are not a reviewer)
- Any phrasing that implies you made code changes, ran tests, or reviewed someone else's work

**REQUIRED FEEDBACK FORMAT** — your feedback MUST contain a \`\`\`json code block with a \`tasks\` array, parseable by the workflow. Optionally include a one-line summary header above the JSON (e.g. \`Plan: 14 tasks (3 small / 8 medium / 3 large), est. ~5.5 hours total.\`). A markdown task list with \`### Role\` headers + numbered tasks is accepted as a fallback parse, but JSON is strongly preferred. Do NOT submit prose-only feedback — the approve gate cannot parse it.

**IF VALIDATION FAILS** (Phase 1): report the failure, set the validation_failure field, and do NOT produce a task plan. Don't try to "fix" the PRD; flag the missing artifacts and stop.

---

PRD path: ${wf.prdPath}

Use the /planner skill. Read the PRD completely, including acceptance criteria, technical spec, and companion specs referenced in §10.

## Available execution roles:
${roleList}

**CHOOSING THE RIGHT ROLE PER TASK.** When multiple execution roles are
listed above, the right role for each task is determined by the FILES the
task will modify. Mapping:
- Swift / SwiftUI / iOS APIs / \`.xcodeproj\` / iOS test targets / \`.entitlements\` / \`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\` / \`Info.plist\` → \`/ios_dev\`
- HTML / CSS / JS / TS / React / Svelte / Vue / Astro / Vite / Tailwind / web frameworks → \`/frontend_dev\`
- Server code (Node/Go/Python backends), SQL migrations, API contracts, server-side auth → \`/backend_dev\`
- Kotlin / Jetpack Compose / Android Studio → \`/android_dev\`
- Infrastructure-as-code, CI YAML, Docker / Kubernetes → \`/devops\`

If a task touches files predominantly owned by one role, assign that role.
Cross-cutting work goes to the role whose conventions cover the MAJORITY
of the change. **Do not default to the first listed role** — match each
task to its file types.

IMPORTANT: Tasks execute strictly one at a time, sequentially. Do NOT group tasks into "waves" or "parallel batches". Order them so each task builds on prior completed work.

## TASK SIZING — TARGET 10–30 MIN PER TASK + HARD CEILING ON COUNT

Tasks that take longer than ~30 min have HIGH restart cost on failure (the whole task starts over), risk context exhaustion, and make progress hard to observe. Tasks under ~10 min are dominated by fixed overhead (agent boot ~30–60s, role/skill load, context build, commit, feedback POST) and waste runtime. Target the 15–25 min sweet spot.

**HARD CEILING: a plan with more than 25 tasks will be rejected by the workflow.** A typical small-to-medium feature should produce 8–15 tasks; a large multi-surface feature 15–25. If your draft exceeds 25, **re-bundle before submitting** — see the "How to bundle" section below. If you can't get under 25, the PRD is too large for one workflow — split it and report that back, do NOT submit an oversized plan.

### How to bundle — tightly-coupled work is ONE task

The dominant over-decomposition pattern in iOS work is **"separate tasks for tests after all implementation is done"**. This is wrong. Tests for a given surface are written by the agent BUILDING that surface, in the same task. Specifically:

- **A SwiftUI view's implementation + its XCUITest(s) + its accessibility identifiers + its localized strings are ONE TASK.** Not four. The agent writes the view, adds the test, wires the identifiers, and adds the strings in a single turn. They share the same mental model and build state — splitting them just multiplies overhead.
- **A new repository method + its unit tests are ONE TASK.** Not two. The agent writes the method and the test against in-memory ModelContainer in the same turn.
- **A new module's named constants + enums + first consumer are ONE TASK.**
- **A complete screen's localization strings (all keys in one .xcstrings update) is ONE TASK.** Don't split by section.
- **Snapshot tests for new visual surfaces ride with the surface implementation task** — the agent who builds the view also captures the baseline.

Avoid creating a "test phase" at the back of the plan. The pattern "tasks 1-N implement, tasks N+1-2N write tests, tasks 2N+1-3N do verification" is wasteful — it forces N agent boots that could have been done inline at near-zero marginal cost during the original task.

### CRITICAL: Don't duplicate qa_validation's work in task_execution

After task_execution completes, the workflow runs a **dedicated qa_validation step** with these responsibilities (read the actual instruction at workflow.js:4619 if you need detail):

1. **Run the full test suite** (xcodebuild test / vitest / etc.) and report test counts.
2. **Run E2E / Playwright / XCUITest** suites.
3. **Capture visual smoke screenshots** of every AC surface, written to \`docs/pr-evidence/<PRD>/visual/\` (gitignored — write them, do not commit them).
4. **Scan launch console for runtime warnings** (Invalid Configuration, missing color, etc.) and block on them.
5. **Re-run the full suite on every fix-loop round** to verify fixes don't regress.

**Therefore in task_execution, the planner must NOT emit:**

- Tasks named "Full XCUITest suite — first green pass" / "all green" / similar omnibus — qa_validation does this. (G1: REJECTED)
- Tasks named "Flake check — Nx consecutive runs" — qa_validation runs the suite already; flakes show up there. If a specific test is genuinely flaky, mark it with \`XCTSkipIf\` in the implementation task. (G1: REJECTED for N≥2)
- Tasks named "Regression smoke" / "PRD-N regression" / "Verify nothing broke" — qa_validation's full-suite run covers ALL prior tests. There's no need for a separate "smoke" task. (G1: REJECTED)
- Tasks named "PR evidence — screenshot capture" / "Visual conformance screenshots" / "Visual smoke for all surfaces" — qa_validation captures these to the same \`docs/pr-evidence/\` directory the AC verifier reads from. (G1: REJECTED if exhaustive; allowed if scoped to a SPECIFIC artifact that qa_validation won't produce, e.g. "before/after gradient comparison strip for PR body §3".)
- Tasks named "SwiftLint pass" / "static analyzer pass" as a standalone — fold into implementation tasks. Each implementation task should pass lint before committing.

**What task_execution SHOULD include for testing:**

- For each implementation task: write the test(s) for the AC(s) that task covers, IN THE SAME TASK, and verify with \`-only-testing\` on just those tests during iteration. A passing \`-only-testing\` run for the new tests is sufficient signal that the implementation works.
- ONE task for "PR body draft" at the end (qa_validation doesn't write the PR body).

**What task_execution SHOULD NOT include for testing:**

- A "test phase" at the back of the plan with one task per AC's test (the dominant over-decomposition pattern — see "How to bundle" above).
- ANY task whose primary work is running the full test suite. Iterate with \`-only-testing\` during implementation; qa_validation runs the full suite once at the end of task_execution.

### Anti-patterns to BREAK UP — these are NOT coupled work

- **"Final verification" omnibus tasks.** If you genuinely need an end-of-plan task (e.g. PR body draft + a specific artifact qa_validation doesn't produce), split into 2 small tasks. Each is restartable.

## SELF-CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING — REQUIRED

After producing your plan, sanity-check it BEFORE returning the JSON:
- **Total task count ≤ 25.** Plans exceeding this WILL BE REJECTED by the workflow. If you're at 30+, find your largest cluster of one-AC-per-task tests and merge them into their implementation tasks.
- **No standalone "test writing" phase.** Each test should be coupled to the implementation task it covers. If you find a task whose ONLY job is "write XCUITest for AC N", that test belongs in the task that implements the surface AC N covers.
- **No "regression smoke" / "verify nothing broke" tasks at all.** qa_validation's full-suite run covers ALL prior PRD tests (auto-scoped via test-impact analysis). A standalone regression task WILL BE REJECTED, regardless of how many prior PRDs are touched.
- **Size distribution.** Count of small/medium/large. If >50% are small (<15 min), re-bundle related ones.
- **Estimated total wall-time.** Sum size midpoints (small=10, medium=22, large=37 min). If total > 8 hours, the PRD is too large — report back, don't submit.

Include a one-line summary at the top of your feedback (before the JSON code block): "Plan: N tasks (X small / Y medium / Z large), est. ~H hours total."

Run Phase 1 (input validation) first. If validation fails, report the failure — do NOT produce a task plan. If validation passes, proceed to Phase 2 (task plan).

Review the code changes in this branch.\n\nPRD path: ${wf.prdPath}\nUse the /code-review skill at ${(config.code_review && config.code_review.effort) || 'high'} effort — a multi-angle, recall-biased pass: surface every plausible issue then verify, don't stop at the first few. Review all changes, check for quality, correctness, and adherence to project standards.\n\n## REVIEW SCOPE RULES\n1. **Only review code changes in this branch** — do not review pre-existing code or suggest refactors outside the PRD scope.\n2. **Check the PRD's "Out of scope" section** — do not raise issues about excluded items.\n3. **Classify findings** as BLOCKING or NON-BLOCKING. Be conservative with BLOCKING.\n4. **If code is correct, say "APPROVE."** Do not invent concerns.\n5. **Use the structured review format** from AGENTS.md.${designCheck}\n7. **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA COVERAGE** — Read the PRD and verify that EVERY acceptance criterion has corresponding code changes. If an AC has no implementation at all, mark it BLOCKING. Include an "AC Coverage" section in your review listing each AC and whether it's covered by the code changes.\n8. **MOCK-ONLY COVERAGE** — Check if any acceptance criteria that depend on external services (LLM calls, third-party APIs, hardware) are only tested with mocked responses. Flag these as "MOCK-ONLY — real integration unverified" in your review so they are flagged for manual testing during demo review. Not all projects use mocks — only flag this when the project's tests actually mock external dependencies.\n9. **MULTI-ANGLE RECALL** — cover these angles explicitly (each has shipped real merged defects): (a) correctness across ALL entity/type variants the spec covers and BOTH directions of every toggle — not just the path the implementation took; (b) silent fail-safe drops (returns 200 while quietly discarding an invalid field); (c) removed or weakened prior behavior; (d) cross-file / contract drift; (e) altitude — a third copy of logic that will drift; (f) dead / unused error contracts; (g) test scaffolding leaked into production (env hooks, ungated test seams).\n\nThis is round ${wf.round}.${reviewContext}`;

**Your findings are ADVISORY: they are surfaced for the operator and later steps, but they do NOT block the merge or trigger a fix loop.** The full spec-derived acceptance-criteria × variant matrix was already enumerated and tested BEFORE implementation, at the qa_tests step (read its coverage matrix in the qa_tests feedback — those cells are covered by definition; do not re-flag them). Your job now is the residual pass against the REAL implementation — catch what a pre-implementation, spec-only enumeration cannot:

1. **Implementation-introduced variants** — a branch, type, state, or error path the CODE added that the spec did not name, and that therefore has no test.
2. **Silent fail-safe drops** — a code path that returns success (200 / no error) while quietly discarding an invalid field or skipping work, where the only covering test asserts the happy path.

You do NOT write code, write tests, run tests, or fix bugs. Read the qa_tests coverage matrix + the implementation diff + the test files, and report residual gaps.

PRD path: ${wf.prdPath}${variantSection}

## PROCESS

1. Read the qa_tests coverage matrix (in the qa_tests step feedback) — that is the already-covered cell set. Do NOT re-flag those cells.
2. Read the implementation diff. For each new branch / type / state / error path it introduces, check that a test exercises it.
3. Check every input-accepting path for silent drops (success returned while input is discarded) and confirm a negative/rejection test exists.
4. Report residual gaps only — anything already in the qa_tests matrix is covered.

## FEEDBACK FORMAT — MANDATORY (machine-parsed; ADVISORY, non-blocking)

**Approved:** yes | no
**Blocking:** N  |  **Medium:** N  |  **Low:** N

### Residual Coverage Gaps
| Source | Cell | Covered? | Note |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| impl-introduced | <branch/type/state> | NO | no test for the code path added at <file:line> |
| silent-drop | <input field> | NO | handler returns success while dropping it; no rejection test |

### Summary
[Residual gaps beyond the qa_tests matrix, or "none — implementation matches the pre-enumerated matrix." Advisory; name the highest-risk one for the operator.]

### Action Items
- [ ] [QA] — add test: <cell> asserting <expected behavior / rejection>

Report honestly. Note: this step does NOT block — even Approved: no advances the workflow. The counts are recorded so the operator and final_review can weigh them.`,

Regression XCUITests take 20-40 min and aren't validating *this PRD's* surface — they're re-running unrelated tests that haven't changed. Skip them this round; the operator runs full regression manually via the **Operations → UITests** tab before pushing to remote.

This branch adds or modifies **${testClasses.length} XCUITest file(s)** (vs \`main\`):
${testClasses.length > 0 ? testClasses.map(c => '- `' + c + '`').join('\n') : '- _(none — only unit tests will run this round)_'}

**Use this scoped invocation INSTEAD of the broad command in §5:**

\`\`\`
xcodebuild test \\
  -project ${iosProject} \\
  -scheme ${iosScheme} \\
  -destination "$BUILD_STUDIO_SIMULATOR_DESTINATION" \\
  ${parallelFlag} \\
${onlyTestingFlags} \\
  2>&1 | tee /tmp/qa-test-output.log
\`\`\`

The first \`-only-testing:${unitTarget}\` flag scopes to all unit tests in the unit-test target; subsequent \`-only-testing:Target/Class\` flags scope XCUITest to just the new/modified classes. Any pre-existing XCUITest file unchanged in this branch is intentionally excluded — that coverage runs in the manual regression step.`;

This is an iOS project. xcodebuild has gotchas that have stalled QA on this project before. Follow these:

1. **One xcodebuild at a time.** Before launching xcodebuild, check for an in-flight run: \`ps aux | grep "[x]codebuild test" | grep -v grep\`. If one is already running, DO NOT spawn another — the simulator handles one test session at a time. A second xcodebuild queues behind the first, doubling wallclock and creating zombies that need manual cleanup. Wait for the existing one to finish (poll its PID, don't spawn a Monitor that waits silently — see point 6).

2. **Use the pinned simulator destination.** The \`BUILD_STUDIO_SIMULATOR_DESTINATION\` env var holds the stable UDID set by the workflow. Always use \`-destination "$BUILD_STUDIO_SIMULATOR_DESTINATION"\`. Name-based lookup is brittle (the actual sim name has a locale suffix the workflow added).

3. **Parallel testing is configured per project — use the flag exactly as shown in the command below; do NOT add or change it.** Parallel cloning halves wallclock, but on some iOS-26 simulator cohorts the clones crash on boot (\`FBSOpenApplicationServiceError\` cascade) and make XCUITests flaky. So this project may run serially (\`-parallel-testing-enabled NO\`) or with a capped worker count — that is intentional. The command below already has the correct flag baked in.

4. **Tee output to a file — do NOT pipe through grep alone.** Piping xcodebuild through grep silently swallows progress lines, which is what makes runs LOOK stuck (this caused QA to spawn duplicate xcodebuild processes in prior runs). Always: \`2>&1 | tee /tmp/qa-test-output.log\`. After the run exits, grep the log: \`grep -E "Executed|FAILED|passed|failed" /tmp/qa-test-output.log | tail -20\`.

5. **Recommended invocation** (substitute your project's scheme + .xcodeproj — find with \`xcodebuild -list\` if unsure):
\`\`\`
xcodebuild test \\\\
  -project ios/<Scheme>.xcodeproj \\\\
  -scheme <Scheme> \\\\
  -destination "$BUILD_STUDIO_SIMULATOR_DESTINATION" \\\\
  ${parallelFlag} \\\\
  2>&1 | tee /tmp/qa-test-output.log
\`\`\`

6. **While xcodebuild runs, tail the log to confirm progress** — DO NOT spawn a Bash Monitor that waits silently. Periodic foreground tail: \`tail -5 /tmp/qa-test-output.log\` (run this every few minutes via the Bash tool). If you see Test Suite / Test Case / Executed lines being added, the run is progressing. If 10+ minutes pass with NO new log lines, the run is genuinely stuck — kill the PID (\`kill -9 <pid>\`) and report environment failure rather than spawning a duplicate. After any \`kill -9\`, run \`node "$XCTEST_CLEAN" --quiet\` to reap the orphaned clones.

7. **Clean up leaked simulator clones — pre AND post (and after any kill).** \`-parallel-testing-enabled YES\` clones the sim into a GLOBAL device set (\`~/Library/Developer/XCTestDevices\`) shared with every other project on this machine. Cancelled or force-killed runs orphan their clones, which accumulate and fill the boot drive (this folder hit 66 GB before the reaper existed). Run \`node "$XCTEST_CLEAN" --quiet\` BEFORE starting and AFTER finishing (success, failure, or kill). It deletes ONLY Shutdown + idle clones, so it is safe to run even while a DIFFERENT project is mid-test — a booted or freshly-created clone is never touched. **Do NOT** use \`xcrun simctl shutdown all\` or \`rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/XCTestDevices/*\` — those would destroy another project's in-flight test run.`

You do NOT capture new evidence (qa_validation does that). You read the code + the qa_validation feedback + the pr-evidence directory, fill in the AC matrix, and submit a structured verification report.**

**FORBIDDEN FEEDBACK FORMAT** — your feedback will be REJECTED if you use any of these patterns:
- \`**All issues addressed:** yes|no\` / \`**Committed:** <hash>\` / \`### Changes\` listing files you modified (FIX-REPORT format — wrong)

**REQUIRED FEEDBACK FORMAT** — your feedback MUST contain:
- \`**Approved:** yes | no\`
- \`**Blocking:** N  |  **Medium:** N  |  **Low:** N\`
- \`### AC Verification Matrix\` table with one row per AC, columns: AC | Description | Status (MET/MOCK-ONLY/PARTIAL/UNMET/UNTESTABLE) | Test Type (AUTOMATED/MOCK/MANUAL) | Evidence (file path or test name)

**IF YOU SEE A BUG OR MISSING IMPLEMENTATION:** mark the affected AC as UNMET or PARTIAL with severity BLOCKING. Add an Action Item naming the role responsible (typically iOS Dev / Backend Dev). DO NOT fix it yourself. DO NOT capture missing screenshots yourself — flag the missing artifact and require the implementing role to capture it.

**APPROVED VS NOT APPROVED — DISTINGUISH OWNER-GATED FROM DEV-GATED:**
Reserve \`**Approved:** no\` for cases where the **implementing role** (iOS Dev, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, etc.) needs to do more work — broken code, missing implementation, missing evidence the dev should have captured (screenshots from simulator runs, font-output pastes the test could emit, etc.). Those route into a fix loop.

**BE CONSERVATIVE ABOUT CREATING OWNER ACTION ITEMS — this is the default, not an edge case.** Every AC you push into \`### Owner action items\` costs the owner real time at a real machine, clicking through real steps, later — this workflow is supposed to be as automatic as possible, and an owner-gated AC is the expensive exception, not a convenient way to defer something you could just check yourself. Before adding ANY AC there, ask: **could I, or another agent, just run/reproduce this right now and get a trustworthy result?** If yes, it is NOT owner-gated — verify it directly (read the code, run the test, reproduce the mutation, replay the flow) instead of pushing it downstream. A litmus test, not exhaustive: pure logic, a deterministic script, a mutation-and-rerun of a test, anything re-derivable from code or committed test output — all agent-verifiable, never owner-gated, regardless of whether the original implementer already claimed to have checked it (their self-report is not evidence; your own reproduction is). Reserve owner-gating for what an agent genuinely cannot do: something requiring a human's senses or judgment (a fast, timing-sensitive UI transition that needs to be watched and screenshotted; visual/perceptual conformance), physical hardware or an installed device, a native OS-level dialog or permission prompt, or an action against a real paid third-party account/service. And even within that set, only add the item when it's well-motivated for genuinely critical functionality — not merely because a test happens to mock a boundary. When in doubt, verify it yourself first; only fall back to an owner item if you concretely cannot.

**ACs that are UNTESTABLE solely because they depend on owner-only actions** (per the conservative bar above — opening the project in Xcode IDE, archiving + uploading to TestFlight / App Store Connect, installing on a physical device, capturing a home-screen photo after install, manual smoke on a preview deploy, watching and screenshotting a fast real-time UI transition, etc.) — are **NOT a reason to set Approved: no**. The dev cannot close those gates; only the owner can, and they close at \`device_testing\` / \`demo_review\` / post-deploy, not via a fix loop. Your \`### Owner action items\` section is not advisory — the engine surfaces it to the owner at \`demo_review\`, informationally (no evidence file required). One bullet per AC, each starting with its id (e.g. \`- AC-2: launch from the Dock, …\`). For these:
- Set \`**Approved:** yes\`
- Keep the AC row marked \`UNTESTABLE\` in the matrix
- Add an \`### Owner action items\` section listing each pending owner gate (one bullet per AC) so demo_review has a checklist
- DO NOT count them in \`**Blocking:** N\`

Use \`**Approved:** no\` ONLY when at least one AC is UNMET, PARTIAL, or UNTESTABLE due to a missing-artifact-the-dev-should-have-captured. If every UNTESTABLE row is owner-gated and there are zero UNMET / PARTIAL rows and zero dev-captureable missing artifacts, the answer is \`**Approved:** yes\` with owner action items — not \`**Approved:** no\`.

You are an Acceptance Criteria Verifier. Your job is to verify that the implementation meets EVERY acceptance criterion in the PRD.

PRD path: ${wf.prdPath}

## Process

1. Read the PRD file completely
2. Extract ALL acceptance criteria (look for sections titled "Acceptance Criteria", lines with "AC-N:", numbered criteria, or checkbox items in the PRD)
3. For EACH acceptance criterion:
   a. Check if there is code that implements it (search the codebase in this branch)
   b. Check if there is a passing test that covers it
   c. Determine the TEST TYPE for each AC:
      - MOCK: Test uses mocked API/LLM responses — verifies UI logic only
      - INTEGRATION: Test hits the real backend endpoint — verifies actual data flow
      - MANUAL: Requires human verification (e.g., real LLM output quality, visual conformance, app icon appearance)
   d. **For MANUAL ACs, verify an EVIDENCE ARTIFACT exists**: every AC marked MANUAL in your matrix MUST cite a concrete file path in its Evidence column (e.g. \`docs/pr-evidence/PRD-001-ios-scaffolding/visual/today-screen.png\`, \`docs/pr-evidence/PRD-001-ios-scaffolding.md#fonts\`). **Every evidence path MUST be FULLY QUALIFIED — no \`...\` ellipsis, no \`<PRD>\` placeholder, no relative shorthand.** Write the same full path on every row even when it gets repetitive — the approval gate file-exists-checks each cited path literally, and a row with \`docs/pr-evidence/.../visual/foo.png\` will be rejected as a missing artifact even when the real file is present. You MUST verify each cited file exists in the worktree via \`ls\` or \`fs\`. **Marking MANUAL as MET without a committed evidence artifact is a hard error.** If no artifact exists, classify which kind of MANUAL it is:
      - **Dev-captureable MANUAL** (simulator screenshot, font-output paste, byte-check log, runbook excerpt, a controlled mutation-and-rerun of a test — anything YOU or another agent could produce/reproduce right now by running the code): this is the default. Either reproduce it yourself and mark it MET with your own fresh evidence, or if it genuinely needs the implementing role (not just re-running something you could run), mark UNTESTABLE and **Approved: no** with an Action Item for them. This routes back through fix loop — it does NOT go to the owner. Do not label something owner-gated just because an existing test mocks a boundary or because the original implementer only self-reported doing it.
      - **Owner-gated MANUAL** (Xcode IDE open, TestFlight upload, on-device install, home-screen photo after install, manual preview-deploy smoke, watching/screenshotting a real-time UI transition too fast to script) — reserve this for cases no agent can do at all, and only when well-motivated for genuinely critical functionality: mark UNTESTABLE but keep **Approved: yes**, list it under \`### Owner action items\` (one bullet per AC, starting with its id). Owner closes the gate at device_testing / demo_review — fix loop cannot help. This is the expensive, sparingly-used path — see the conservatism note above before reaching for it.
   e. If possible, run the feature flow end-to-end to verify it works
   f. Rate each AC:
      - MET: Code exists AND verified by automated test with no mocked external dependencies (or project doesn't use mocks) — OR for MANUAL gates, the cited evidence artifact exists and substantively supports the claim
      - MOCK-ONLY: Test passes but mocks external services (LLM, third-party APIs, hardware) — real wiring unverified
      - PARTIAL: Code exists but implementation is incomplete
      - UNMET: No implementation found
      - UNTESTABLE: Cannot verify in this environment, OR MANUAL gate has no evidence artifact — explain why
4. **Cross-check against qa_validation findings.** Read the qa_validation feedback for this round. If QA flagged any \`[Invalid Configuration]\` / asset-not-found / render-wrong runtime warning, treat the affected ACs (anything visual or color-dependent) as PARTIAL or UNMET — the test suite passing does not mean the AC is met when the app renders with fallback colors at runtime.
5. **Check the visual evidence directory** \`docs/pr-evidence/<PRD-basename>/visual/\` for any AC that depends on visible rendering (greetings, metric values, icons, empty states, brand colors). If the directory does not exist or is empty, visual-dependent ACs cannot be marked MET — mark them UNTESTABLE and require the implementing role to capture screenshots.
6. Report using the structured review format from AGENTS.md

## CRITICAL RULES

- UNMET or PARTIAL is BLOCKING — the implementation is incomplete
- **MANUAL with no committed evidence artifact is UNTESTABLE, not MET.** Source-code review alone is insufficient for MANUAL gates. The PRD declared the gate manual because it requires evidence beyond what code reading can provide (a rendered screenshot, a font-output paste, a byte-check log). Without that artifact in the repo, the gate has not been verified by anyone.
- MOCK-ONLY is NOT blocking but must be flagged for manual verification during demo review
- Not all projects use mocks — check whether the project's test infrastructure actually mocks external services before applying the MOCK-ONLY label
- For projects that DO use mocks: pay special attention to data flow through external services. Does the user's input actually reach the external API call? Does the response contain what the user configured, not invented defaults?
- For mobile projects: distinguish what can be verified in simulator vs what requires real device testing
- Integration tests that call real external services should NOT be run automatically (cost/rate-limit concerns) — they exist for manual execution or CI/CD pre-production gates
- Use the /qa skill for running tests if needed

## Report format

Use the structured review format:

**Approved:** yes | no
**Blocking:** N  |  **Medium:** N  |  **Low:** N

| AC-1 | ... | MET/MOCK-ONLY/PARTIAL/UNMET/UNTESTABLE | AUTOMATED/MOCK/MANUAL | test name or verification details |
| AC-2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

The first column MUST use the PRD's own acceptance-criteria identifiers verbatim — either flat \`AC-1\`, \`AC-2\` … or per-user-story \`US-1.1\`, \`US-1.2\`, \`US-2.1\` …. Do not invent a parallel \`AC-N\` numbering when the PRD uses \`US-N.M\`; the dashboard accepts either style and parses both. Mismatched or invented identifiers break the demo-review summary.

**Your job: an adversarial, recall-biased review of the whole change before it ships. You do NOT write code. You do NOT fix bugs. You read, hunt, and report a structured review.**

**START FROM THE SPEC, NOT THE DIFF.** Every earlier gate read the diff and inherited the implementer's mental model — that is why defects survive to here. Do the opposite: read the PRD acceptance criteria + the architecture / data model FIRST and write down what the system SHOULD do across all inputs and entity types. THEN go find where the implementation diverges. Treat "the code looks like it does what it intends" as unproven until you have checked it against the spec across every variant.

**BIAS TOWARD RECALL.** Surface every plausible issue, then verify. A false positive costs a sentence; a missed defect ships. Do not stop at the first few findings.

PRD path: ${wf.prdPath}

## HOW TO REVIEW
Use the /code-review skill at ${frEffort} effort (its multi-angle finder→verify structure). Cover these angles explicitly — each has caught real, merged defects:
1. **Correctness across all inputs** — every entity/type the spec covers (not just the one the impl took), both directions of every toggle, empty/single/multi/invalid payloads. Does a whole class of entity get skipped on a state change?
2. **Silent, fail-safe drops** — code paths that return success (HTTP 200 / no error) while quietly discarding a field or skipping work (e.g. \`safeParse\` → drop instead of reject). Nothing green catches these; hunt them.
3. **Removed / altered behavior** — did the change silently drop or weaken behavior that existed before?
4. **Cross-file / contract drift** — callers and callees still agree on types, shapes, error contracts.
5. **Altitude / duplication** — a third copy of logic that will drift; something that belongs one layer up or down.
6. **Dead / unused error contracts** — declared errors never thrown, branches never reached.
7. **Test scaffolding leaked to prod** — env-based behavior hooks (\`process.env.* === 'fail'\`), test seams not gated by \`NODE_ENV !== 'production'\`, debug backdoors.
8. **Spec conformance** — every AC actually satisfied across all its variants, not just demoed on the happy path.

## SCOPE
Review the change for this PRD. Do not raise pre-existing issues outside the PRD's blast radius, and respect the PRD's "Out of scope" section. Be conservative labeling BLOCKING, but do not suppress a real correctness/spec-violation finding to be polite.${((config.workflow && config.workflow.execution) || []).includes('demo_review') ? `

**Owner-gated ACs close DOWNSTREAM, not here.** ACs that need a human at the machine (Dock launch, native OS dialogs, DevTools probes on the running packaged app) are surfaced to the owner at \`demo_review\` from the AC verifier's \`### Owner action items\` section — the owner confirms them there informationally, no committed evidence required. So absent owner-execution evidence is NOT a blocking finding for you. What you DO verify: the AC verifier's \`### Owner action items\` section exists and covers every owner-gated AC — a missing or incomplete checklist IS blocking, because it is what feeds that gate.` : ''}

**This is NOT a retrospective on the fix workflow.** The fix run went fine — that is not interesting. The interesting question is about the ORIGINAL defect: **why did this bug exist, and why did the gates that were supposed to catch it let it through?** The goal is to prevent the *class* of bug, not to praise the fix.

Bug item: ${wf.prdPath}   (read it — description, repro, and fix design)
Fix diff: run \`git diff ${wf.defaultBranch || 'main'}...HEAD\` to see exactly what changed. Use \`git log\`/\`git blame\` on the touched lines to find when and how the original code was introduced if it helps the analysis.

## ANALYZE (write your reasoning in feedback, briefly)

1. **Root cause — why was the bug introduced?** Classify the mistake, don't just restate the symptom: missing edge case / wrong assumption / unhandled error or state / contract drift between caller and callee / race or ordering / off-by-one / copy-paste divergence / etc.
2. **Slip-through — which gate SHOULD have caught it, and why didn't it?** Be specific about the ORIGINAL PRD's gates:
   - **Test coverage** — was there a missing test case that would have failed? (usually the answer for logic bugs)
   - **Code review** — was there a review angle that would have flagged it? (contract drift, a whole-class-of-input miss)
   - **AC verification** — was an acceptance criterion under-specified or unverified?
   - Or was it **genuinely unforeseeable / environmental / a dependency change** — nobody's gate could reasonably have caught it.
3. **Durable lesson — is there one?** Only if there is a GENERALIZABLE pattern that would prevent this whole class of bug: a test you should always write for this kind of code, a review angle to add, a code idiom to prefer.

## OUTPUT — 0 to 2 learnings; ZERO IS A FULLY VALID, COMMON OUTCOME

Many bugs teach nothing durable — a one-off typo, an unforeseeable dependency break, a genuinely novel edge. When that's the case, write NO learning file and say so plainly in your feedback: state the root cause, the slip point, and "no durable/generalizable lesson — not capturing." Do not manufacture a learning to look productive.

Write a learning ONLY when the lesson is reusable AND cross-project. Classification:
- **CROSS-PROJECT** (→ a learning file): a pattern that applies to any project on similar tech (e.g. "always test the retry path after a partial-commit failure with the target repointed", "cross-product state must be keyed on productId, not draftId").
- **PROJECT-SPECIFIC** (→ NOT a learning): this project's paths, schema, config, or infra. Mention it in feedback and, if the repo has ARCHITECTURE.md, propose the exact edit there instead.

## FILE FORMAT (only if you are writing a learning)

\`docs/learnings/<category>/<slug>.md\` — categories: architecture, backend, frontend, devops, qa, security, workflow.
\`\`\`
---
title: "<the reusable lesson, phrased as guidance — not 'we had a bug'>"
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
severity: high | medium | low
tags: [3-8 lowercase keywords]
component: <testing | api | rendering | auth | database | general | ...>
evidence: "${wf.input} — <the slip point, e.g. 'no test for repointed-target retry; original code_review missed the contract drift'>"
---

1-3 sentences: the root cause, the slip point (which gate should catch it next time), and the concrete prevention (the test/pattern/angle).
\`\`\`
Slug from the title (lowercase, hyphens, ≤60 chars). Write BOTH copies: \`docs/learnings/<category>/<slug>.md\` (project) AND \`${agentDashboardPath}/docs/learnings/<category>/<slug>.md\` (global, so other projects benefit).

## RULES
- Merge before create: scan existing docs/learnings/ first; UPDATE an overlapping entry (sharpen it, add this evidence) instead of duplicating.
- The lesson must be about PREVENTING THE CLASS, not this one instance.
- Commit your changes (even a zero-learning run: nothing to commit is fine — just report the analysis). ${COMMIT_ON_CURRENT_BRANCH}${promotionHint}`,
        }];
        wf.steps.capture_learnings = { status: 'running', agents: launchWorkflowAgents(wf, slipAgent, { useWorktrees: false }) };
        state.saveWorkflow(wf);
        return res.json({ workflow: wf });
      }

      const captureAgent = [{
        role: 'Knowledge Curator', window: 'learnings', status: 'pending', reportFeedback: true,
        instruction: `You are a Knowledge Curator. Review the completed workflow and extract reusable learnings.

Workflow log: ${logFile}
Read the workflow log for the full feedback history from all agents across all rounds.

## THIS RUN'S SIGNAL — capture only what the failures taught

This run: ${runSignal.rounds} round(s), fix work: ${runSignal.hadFixWork ? `yes (${runSignal.fixCycleCount} fix cycle(s))` : 'no'}, operator overrides: ${runSignal.overrideCount}, hygiene-gate trips: ${runSignal.hygieneTrips}.

**Hard limits — the learnings pool must stay small to stay useful:**
1. **At most 3 new learnings from this run. Zero is a good outcome** — write learnings only for lessons the fix rounds / overrides / gate trips actually taught. Do not write "we did X and it worked" entries.
2. **Every learning must cite its evidence**: the round + finding (or override/gate trip) it came from, in a \`evidence:\` frontmatter field (e.g. \`evidence: "r2 code_review BLOCKING-1"\`). No evidence, no learning.
3. **Merge before create**: search existing docs/learnings/ files first. If a lesson overlaps an existing entry, UPDATE that file (sharpen the title/content, add the new evidence) instead of creating a near-duplicate.
${promotionHint}

## Classification — THIS IS CRITICAL

Every learning must be classified as either:

**CROSS-PROJECT** — A pattern that applies to ANY project using similar technology. Examples:
- "Escape </ in JSON embedded in <script> blocks" ← applies everywhere
- "Date-only strings parse as UTC midnight" ← universal JS/Node pitfall
- "XSS test assertions must account for structural script tags" ← general testing pattern

**PROJECT-SPECIFIC** — Something unique to THIS project's setup, config, or codebase. These should NOT go in learnings files. Examples:
- "Need to copy backend/.env to worktrees" ← this is a project config fix (worktree_env_files in config.yaml)
- "Port 4000 conflicts with Build Studio" ← infrastructure issue, not a code pattern
- "This project uses Fastify not Express" ← project fact, not a learning
- Anything about this project's specific file paths, database schema, or deployment setup

DO NOT write project-specific items as learnings. Instead, mention them in your feedback so the team can fix the config or docs directly — and if the repo has an ARCHITECTURE.md at its root, propose the exact edit to its relevant component section (component facts, guardrails, and test-infrastructure notes belong THERE, not in the learnings pool).

## File Format — ONE FILE PER LEARNING

Each learning is a separate markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

\`\`\`
docs/learnings/<category>/<slug>.md
\`\`\`

Categories: architecture, backend, frontend, devops, qa, security, workflow

Example file \`docs/learnings/security/escape-script-closing-tags-in-embedded-json.md\`:

\`\`\`markdown
---
title: "Escape </ in JSON embedded in <script> blocks"
date: 2026-03-22
severity: high
tags: [xss, json, script, escape, html]
component: rendering
---

JSON.stringify does not escape </script> sequences. Any <script> element ends when the HTML parser sees </, so host-controlled content can break out of a JSON config block. Fix: .replace(/<\\//g, '<\\\\/') on the stringified output before embedding.
\`\`\`

### Frontmatter fields:
- **title**: Clear, actionable title (the learning itself, not a description of what happened)
- **date**: YYYY-MM-DD when discovered
- **severity**: high (build/deploy failure), medium (bug), low (style/preference)
- **tags**: Lowercase keywords for search — technical terms, APIs, tools involved. 3-8 tags.
- **component**: What area — testing, build, rendering, api, auth, database, general
- **evidence**: The round + finding / override / gate trip this lesson came from (e.g. "r2 code_review BLOCKING-1") — required

### File naming:
- Slug from the title, lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars
- Example: \`escape-script-closing-tags-in-embedded-json.md\`

### Where to write:
1. Write to \`docs/learnings/<category>/<slug>.md\` (project copy)
2. ALSO write the same file to \`${agentDashboardPath}/docs/learnings/<category>/<slug>.md\` (global copy, so other projects benefit)

## Housekeeping

Before adding new entries, scan existing files in docs/learnings/:
- If a new learning overlaps with an existing file, update the existing file instead of creating a duplicate
- If an existing learning is no longer relevant (e.g., fixed in a dependency update), delete the file
- The system uses tags and content for relevance search — good tags make learnings discoverable

## Rules
- Do NOT duplicate learnings that already exist — check existing files first (merge-before-create, see Hard limits above)
- Only capture genuinely reusable patterns, not one-off fixes
- **0–3 new learnings per workflow.** Zero is a good outcome on a run whose failures taught nothing new.
- The body should be 1-3 sentences: what the problem is, why it happens, and how to fix/prevent it
- Commit your changes. ${COMMIT_ON_CURRENT_BRANCH}`,

## EXECUTION GUIDANCE

- Work through the tasks in order. They are listed in the order the fix planner emitted them.
- **Commit per task** (one git commit per fix), so each commit message references the fix id (e.g. \`fix(prd-XXX): ... (${fixPlan.tasks[0]?.id || 'task-id'})\`). The dashboard's findings checklist auto-checks items by matching commit messages to finding IDs — accurate commits keep the operator's progress view accurate. ${COMMIT_ON_CURRENT_BRANCH}
- Stay within scope. Do NOT refactor unrelated code or fix pre-existing issues outside these tasks.
- If a task uncovers an issue that's clearly out of scope, note it in your final feedback under "## Out of scope (defer)" but do not address it now.
- After all tasks: rebuild + run the relevant test suite to confirm no regressions, then POST your structured feedback.

Use the /${resolvedRole.skill} skill.
