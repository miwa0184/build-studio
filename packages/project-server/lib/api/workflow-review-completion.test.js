//   3. clean approval in-round  → straight to 'completed'          ❌
//
// Paths 2 and 3 skipped companion_specs, and because the backlog transition

// Drafted. fazon FAZ-218 (2026-08-01) hit path 2: the review ran its full four
// rounds, capped at round 5, reported "completed", and left the item Drafted
// with two of three Required companion specs never written — while the PRD's
// own preparation gate says every Required spec must exist before execution.
//
// These read the source rather than driving the express app, because what is
// being pinned is a control-flow invariant across three handlers.
