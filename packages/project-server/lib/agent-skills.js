/**
 * Making role definitions and skills reachable for agents that are not Claude.
 *
 * Build Studio scaffolds a project's role definitions into `.claude/commands/`
 * and its workflow skills into `.claude/skills/` (see onboard.js), and the step
 * prompts refer to them by name: "Use the /qa skill", "Use the
 * `qa-browser-testing` skill for any browser-based verification".
 *
 * Those are Claude Code paths. A codex or opencode agent cannot load either, so
 * for those CLIs the reference is not merely unhelpful — it names a capability
 * the agent does not have and cannot get. What it does instead is substitute
 * something of its own, and that substitute is chosen without any knowledge of
 * what the project actually provides.
 *
 * Observed end-to-end on a hello-world bugfix (HW-003, 2026-08-09). The codex QA
 * agent said so itself:
 *
 *   "The requested /qa and qa-browser-testing skills aren't available in this
 *    session, so I'll follow the supplied QA protocol directly."
 *   "I'm using the available in-app browser control skill for that verification
 *    (the specifically requested qa-browser-testing skill is absent)."
 *
 * It reached for codex's own bundled browser runtime — whose instructions
 * explicitly say to try it "before falling back to standalone Playwright" —
 * got `No browser is available` in a headless tmux pane, and reported the gap as
 * a BLOCKING defect. `playwright-cli`, which the absent skill documents and
 * which was installed the whole time, was never invoked once. Two fix rounds
 * followed, none of which could have helped: the one-character typo the run was
 * about had been correctly fixed in the first commit.
 *
 * So the reference is resolved here instead, at the single point where the
 * agent's CLI is known, and the file's contents are appended to the prompt for
 * any CLI that cannot read it natively.
 *
 * Resolution is by existence, never by a hardcoded list: a name is inlined only
 * when a matching file is actually on disk in this project. A list would drift
 * silently every time a project adds a role, and the failure mode of drift here
 * is exactly the one this module exists to remove.

/**
 * Capabilities that live INSIDE the Claude binary, with no file to inline.
 *
 * The `.claude/` resolution above works because those definitions are files: a
 * project edits `commands/qa.md` and every CLI sees the change. `/code-review`
 * cannot work that way. The one the review prompts mean — the effort-scaled
 * pass over the current diff — is compiled into the claude executable; there is
 * no skills directory on disk to read. (A same-named marketplace plugin does
 * exist as a file, but it is a different tool: it drives `gh pr diff`, launches
 * Haiku/Sonnet sub-agents and posts a GitHub PR comment. Inlining it would
 * point a Build Studio reviewer at a pull request instead of the branch diff
 * and tell it to comment on GitHub instead of POSTing structured feedback.)
 *
 * So this translates the reference instead of resolving it: for a CLI that
 * cannot run the harness, say what the harness DOES. Measured cost of not
 * doing so — the reviewer says "skill is not available in this session, so
 * I'll use the project's review instructions" (fazon PRD-105 round 1, codex)
 * and silently runs a single pass where the prompt specified recall-biased
 * multi-pass. Every code review in this installation was affected, because the
 * review slot is codex.
 *
 * Only the AFFIRMATIVE form is rewritten. Several prompts say "Do NOT use the
 * /code-review skill and do NOT launch parallel sub-agents" to keep a targeted
 * re-review cheap — turning that into a description of the method would invert
 * the instruction.
