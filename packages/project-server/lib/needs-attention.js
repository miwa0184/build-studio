 * "Can this workflow proceed without a human, and if not, why?"

 * The engine already halts correctly in half a dozen places, but each one
 * records itself differently — `step.autoAdvanceError`, `step.status ===
 * 'blocked'`, a `review_cap_reached` step, a manual gate, a completed run still
 * holding the slot. Nothing named the *condition*, so every consumer
 * (auto-advance, the hub, the Backlog Start button) re-derived it from a
 * different subset and disagreed.
 *
 * This is the one answer. It is DERIVED, never stored: a stored flag goes stale
 * the moment a step advances, and a stale "needs you" is worse than none.
 *
 * Returns null when the workflow can proceed on its own, otherwise:
 *   { reason, step, title, detail, action }
 *
 * `reason` is a stable machine key; `title` and `detail` are for humans; and
 * `action` says what actually clears it. Every case here is waiting on a
 * PERSON — nothing in this list resolves itself with time.
