/**
 * Recovering an agent that finished its work and then exited without reporting.
 *
 * The pattern has now appeared four times across three CLIs: the agent writes
 * the files, makes the commit, and ends without running its feedback POST. The
 * workflow then waits forever on a report that will never come, while the work
 * sits finished on the branch.
 *
 * `transcript-recovery.js` handles the case where the agent's own words survive
 * — but that reads Claude's JSONL session file, and codex and opencode write
 * nothing of the kind. For those, the only surviving evidence is what landed in
 * git. That is weaker evidence, and this module is careful about the
 * difference: it reconstructs a statement of WHAT IS ON DISK, and says so, in
 * place of a verdict the agent never delivered.
 *
 * The distinction matters because the alternative is worse in both directions.
 * Relaunching redoes work that is already committed (and risks conflicting with
 * it), while inventing a plausible-sounding report would put words in an
 * agent's mouth and quietly turn "we don't know" into "approved".
 *
 * That reasoning holds only for agents whose deliverable IS the diff. For a
 * planner it inverts — see PLANNING_ROLES below.
 */

/**
 * Roles whose deliverable is a plan, not a diff.
 *
 * Git reconstruction is structurally incapable of recovering these. A planner
 * writes no code; its entire output is the JSON task list it POSTs. So the
 * commits this module would find on the branch are never the planner's — they
 * belong to the Dev agents of earlier rounds — and a summary of them is
 * evidence about someone else's work filed under the planner's name.
 *
 * Worse, it is a dead end rather than a mistake the operator can undo: the
 * fix_plan approval gate parses planner feedback for a ```json block, prose
 * cannot satisfy it, and the step is left `done` holding content that can never
 * pass. Observed on a fazon PRD-105 round-3 fix_plan (2026-08-09), where codex
 * died before emitting a single token and Recover filed the round-2 iOS Dev's
 * nine commits in its place; the run then had no button out.
 *
 * Transcript recovery is unaffected and remains the right path — a planner's
 * own words DO contain its plan. Only the git fallback is refused here.
