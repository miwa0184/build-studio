/**
 * Dead-vs-stalled agent discrimination + auto-resume decisions (Tier 2 of the
 * agent-protection design, 2026-07-17).
 *
 * Two failure modes previously produced the identical "no log activity for 15
 * minutes" stall error, but they need OPPOSITE remedies:
 *
 *  - ALIVE but silent (e.g. waiting at an interactive dialog — the
 *    finance-studio folder-trust kickoff): relaunching destroys context; a
 *    human must answer. Keep the slow stall timeout.
 *  - DEAD (SIGKILL under memory pressure, daemon-crash fallout, CLI update —
 *    the launch-studio PRD-010 qa_validation kill): waiting 15 minutes is
 *    waste; the right move is an immediate `claude --resume <session-id>`,
 *    which restores the agent's full conversation context.
 *
 * The discriminator is tmux's `#{pane_current_command}` — but on its own it is
 * WEAKER than it looks, and an earlier version of this comment overstated it.
 * It reports the foreground process GROUP LEADER, and agents are launched as
 * `bash start-<agent>.sh` without `exec`, so the leader is that wrapper script
 * for the agent's whole life: the pane reads `bash` even while `claude` runs
 * healthily beneath it as a non-leader member of the same group. The claim that
 * "its pane command stays `claude`" was simply wrong, and every check that
 * trusted the pane command alone misfired on live agents (2026-08-18).
 *
 * So a shell pane is NOT proof of death. Death needs all of: a shell pane, no
 * live child process under the pane, AND a pipe-pane log silent for
 * `deadConfirmMs`. `paneReturnedToShell()` is the single place that rule lives;
 * use it rather than calling `isShellCommand()` directly.
 *
 * All functions here are pure — the tmux/fs I/O lives in server.js.

/**
 * Has an agent previously judged dead come back to life?
 *
 * The dead/stall verdict is normally final — re-running it would only rewrite
 * the same error. But it is a verdict about a process, and a human can change
 * that fact from outside: answering a prompt in the live terminal, or restarting
 * the CLI by hand, revives an agent the watchdog has already written off.
 *
 * Observed on a fazon fix_execution run: the pane fell back to a shell, the
 * agent was marked `error` ("process exited... after 20m of work"), the owner
 * answered the blocking question in the terminal, and the agent carried on
 * working — while the card still showed an error and offered Recover and
 * Approve, both of which would have moved the step and caused the agent's
 * eventual report to be REJECTED as belonging to a closed step.
 *
 * Revival needs BOTH signals, because either alone is weak: a live process could
 * be idle at a prompt, and recent log output could be a dying process's last
 * gasp. Together they mean a real agent process is running AND producing output
 * right now.
 *
 * **This was unreachable in practice until 2026-08-18.** It rejected any pane
 * whose command was a shell, which — because the launcher's wrapper script is
 * the foreground group leader — is every claude agent, always. So the exact
 * scenario in the paragraph above (owner answers the question, agent resumes)
 * could never clear the error it describes. It now asks whether a live process
 * exists under the pane instead of what the pane is nominally running.
 *
 * Being wrong here is cheap and self-correcting in a way the old behaviour was
 * not: a falsely revived agent is re-judged dead on the next tick, whereas a
 * falsely dead one stays wrong until a human notices.
 *
