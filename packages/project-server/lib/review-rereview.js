/**
 * Targeted re-review for PRD review rounds after the first.
 *
 * Round 1 should sweep the whole document — that is where the real defects are.
 * Rounds 2+ were doing the same thing again: the instruction was byte-identical
 * every round ("Read the PRD file, then analyze it"), with no diff and no
 * changed-section scoping. The only round-awareness was a rule saying *"after
 * round 2, only raise genuinely new issues"*.
 *
 * That combination is a finding generator, not a review. A round-3 reviewer
 * opens the full PRD, is told the only acceptable output is NEW material, and
 * carries a fresh lens (its role skill) to apply. Observed on a real run: a
 * reviewer reported "round-2 blocker is resolved" and then raised three new
 * findings from a surface no earlier round had touched. It did exactly what it
 * was asked to do.
 *
 * `code_review` already solved this for implementation review — rounds > 1 get
 * "verify each fix actually resolves the issue it claims to fix … do not
 * re-audit code that was already approved in round 1". PRD review never got the
 * same treatment; the asymmetry looks accidental rather than designed.
 *
 * Complements `review-wrapup.js` rather than replacing it. This narrows what a
 * re-review LOOKS at (the cause); wrap-up/closure changes what happens to
 * findings that still surface (the symptom). A run wants both: verification
 * first, and a contract for the residue.

/**
 * The feedback a re-reviewing role actually needs: its OWN prior findings, plus
 * every PM fix report.
 *
 * The default history hands each reviewer all six roles' feedback from the last
 * three rounds. That is the bulk of the prompt, and it invites anchoring — Brand
 * reads Architect's blocking finding before forming its own view. For a targeted
 * re-review the question is narrower: *did the fixes close MY findings?*
 *
 * PM fix reports are always included regardless of role, because they are the
 * claim being verified.
 *
 * **The most recent round is delivered in full.** A flat 1200-char cap used to
 * apply to every entry, which on a measured run gave each reviewer 11-18% of its
 * own prior review: the cut landed on the first finding's TITLE, so the bodies —
 * the things being verified — were gone, along with 80% of the PM fix report
 * claiming to close them. One reviewer responded by running `sed` over its own
 * transcript .jsonl to recover what had been cut (fazon, 2026-08-22).
 *
 * Delivering the latest round whole is also the cheap option, which is what
 * settles it: the biggest observed review plus fix report is ~17k chars against
 * the 30.7k-char PRD a truncated reviewer re-reads instead. Older rounds stay
 * capped — their findings were already adjudicated in the round that followed —
 * so the block does not grow without bound as rounds accumulate.

PRD path: ${prdPath}

This is round ${round}. Round 1 swept the whole document; that has happened. Your job now is to
verify that the fixes claimed since your last review actually close the findings YOU raised —
not to audit the document again from a new angle.

## START HERE — THE DELTA, NOT THE DOCUMENT

Run this first. It is the complete set of changes since your last review:

    ${diffCmd}

Work from that diff. Open the PRD only for a section the diff touches or one your own prior
findings name, and read just that range (\`sed -n 'START,ENDp' ${prdPath}\`). Re-reading the whole
document is exactly what this round exists to avoid: it costs a full review and produces findings
about surfaces nobody changed.

## WHAT TO DO

1. Read the diff, then match each of your prior findings below to the change that claims to
   close it.
2. For each one, decide: **CLOSED** (the fix resolves it), **NOT CLOSED** (the fix misses or
   only partly addresses it — say precisely what remains), or **REGRESSED** (the fix broke
   something that previously read correctly).
3. Read only the sections the fixes touched. Do NOT re-read and re-assess sections that no fix
   touched and that you did not previously flag — those were reviewed in round 1 and are
   settled.

## WHAT BLOCKS

- A finding of yours that is **NOT CLOSED** — cite which round it came from.
- A **REGRESSION** introduced by a fix.
- A defect in the changed text that would cause real harm to ship.

## WHAT DOES NOT BLOCK

- Anything you notice by examining a surface no earlier round examined and no fix touched.
  If it is genuinely worth recording, put it under \`### Follow-up proposals\` — it is not a
  reason to withhold approval at this stage.
- Wording, polish or completeness preferences that you did not raise in round 1.

**If every finding of yours is CLOSED, say so and set \`Approved: yes\` with \`Blocking: 0\`.**
That is the expected outcome of a working fix round, not a rubber stamp.

## REVIEW FORMAT — MANDATORY

## Review: ${role}

**Approved:** yes | no
**Blocking:** N  |  **Medium:** N  |  **Low:** N

### Verification of prior findings
- [round N] <your finding, one line> — CLOSED | NOT CLOSED | REGRESSED — <evidence>

### Findings
[Only NOT CLOSED / REGRESSED items, and defects in changed text. If none, say so.]

### Action Items
- [ ] [assignee_role] — description`;
