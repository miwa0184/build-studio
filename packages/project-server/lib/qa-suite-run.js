/**
 * Run the iOS test suite server-side, so the QA agent never has to babysit it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * qa_validation used to render an `xcodebuild test` command into the agent's
 * prompt and ask the agent to run it. Because a foreground run blocks the Bash
 * tool (and, past 15 minutes of log silence, trips the idle-stall watchdog),
 * the prompt also told the agent to background the run and tail the log
 * "every few minutes". In practice "every few minutes" became every ~13
 * seconds, and each poll is a full API request that re-reads the whole
 * conversation from cache.
 *
 * Measured across every QA run we can still see (2026-08-26):
 *
 *   fazon FAZ-286   148 requests,  90 polling,  61% of the step's cache reads
 *   deskrhythm #1    39 requests,  17 polling,  47%
 *   deskrhythm #2    47 requests,  16 polling,  37%
 *
 * On FAZ-286 that was 10.8M cache-read tokens spent watching a counter, in a
 * step that was itself 60% of the whole execution run. Non-iOS projects never
 * had the problem: the polling instructions are gated on a configured
 * simulator, and vitest/playwright runs finish inside one foreground call.
 *
 * The cost is turn COUNT, not context size — context sat flat around 90K while
 * 148 requests each paid to re-read it. Nothing the agent learned from poll 40
 * differed from poll 39. So the run moves here: one child process, no tokens,
 * and the agent starts with the answer instead of waiting for it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not replace the QA agent. Visual smoke, test-data cleanup, failure
 * triage and the gate-parseable report all stay with the agent — only the
 * blocking wait is hoisted.
